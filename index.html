  <p>
    Traffic fatalities are on the rise in the Bronx, and between 2019 and 2020, cyclists, motorists, and pedestrians, have fallen victims to vehicles on the road.
  <p> Using data collected by the NYPD and generated on NYC Open Data set, and NYC Crashmapper, we were able to take a look at each of those accidents and explore the crash data to see if there were any underlying trends and relationships that could
    explain the number of accidents and fatalities occurring.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are three types of collision fatalities that our data explored: motorist, cyclist, and pedestrian.</p>
  <p> Our data shows that in 2019, there were 26 total fatalities among motorists,cyclists, and pedestrians. Whereas, data for 2020, shows that there has been 36 total fatalities amongs cyclists, motorists, and pedestrians. </p>

  <p> Based on the data, motorist fatalities are the highest in the Bronx, with 34 occuring between 2019 and 2020. </p>
  <p>In, 2019, there were 14 motorist fatalities brought on by collisions.But with only 11 weeks left till the new year, 2020 has already seen 20 motorist fatalities caused by collisions.

    One possible explanation for the increase in motorist fatalities is COVID-19. The pandemic has caused many New Yorkers to abstain from using public transportation, in order to avoid touching surfaces, as well as being in close contact with
    people in enclosed areas.

  </p>

  <p>
    Choosing not to use public transportation is one thing. But essential workers cannot just choose to miss work. What's key here is that a majority of the New York City essential workers, hail from the
    Bronx. </p>

  <p>They work in areas such as healthcare, as grocery store clerks, transit workers, and as sanitation workers to name a
    few. There is a possibilty that these essential workers may have been operating vehicles during the pandemic, to avoid contamination on public transit, and to also have their own transportation to work.
  </p>

  <p> In total, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-bronx-coronavirus-crisis-worse-than-manhattan-2020-5#in-2019-manhattans-population-was-about-13-higher-than-that-of-the-bronx-1" text="align">essential</a> workers make up 25% of New York
    City's workforce, and about 17% of those frontline workerslive in the Bronx, while just 12% reside in Manhattan.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our data also takes into account that pedestrians are the second highest fatality caused by collisions in the Bronx. Since 2019, the Bronx has had 22 pedestrain fatalities.
  </p>

    "The number one factor is road redesign and driver speed. A pedestrian struck at 30mph is twice as likely to be killed as a pedestrian struck at 25mph. At 40mph, a driver needs 300 feet to stop but at 25 mph that distance is halved to 150 feet.
    The rising popularity of SUV and trucks also reversed a decades-long streak in decreased pedestrian fatalities, since these vehicles have more flat hoods, are much heavier, excel faster, and are higher off the ground which results in
    pedestrians getting run over more easily," says the research director of <a href="https://www.transalt.org/" text="align"> Transportation Alternatives, </a> Philip Miatkowski. </p>

      A 2019 hit-and-run collision in the Bronx, that resulted in the fatality of a an older woman crossing the street. Witnesses at the crime scene said that they wished the city implemented speed bumps of some sort, so people can slow down and or
      pay
      more attention when driving.

  <p> Transportation Alternatives' mission is to create a public space, so that New Yorkers can reclaim New York City’s streets from cars, which happen to be the number one contributor to fatalities in New York City.

  <p>Their advocacy is responsible for the introduction of America’s first protected bike lanes and the world’s largest speed camera program. Their determination and strong advocacy assisted them in getting a lower citywide speed limit for the first
    time in 50 years.</p>
  <p> Not only this, but they are also responsible for the introduction of Vision Zero, a multi-national road traffic safety project that aims to achieve a highway system with no fatalities or serious injuries involving road traffic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even with the implementation of bike lanes, 2020 has seen an increase in cyclist fatalities. In 2019, there were no cyclist fatalities brought on by collision in the Bronx, but now in 2020, we have seen six. The first fatalitiy occurred in June,
    following August, September, and November.
  </p>

    <figcaption> This year, the Bronx has experienced a total of six cyclist fatalities. This is an increase since 2019, which saw no cyclist fatalities.</figcaption>

  <p>
    COVID-19 State guidelines have limited public dinning, therefore, the need for food delivery is greater, and one of the quickest and easiest ways to navigate a busy city is on bike. For this case, it may be that the Bronx is seeing an increase
    of
    bicycle usage, and potentially bike usage with essential workers who are delivering food from restaurants, as well as packages from other messenger delivery services. </p>
  </p>
  <p> Our dataset also pointed us in the direction of what contributed to the collisions in the first place. The main contributor for Motorist fatalities in the Bronx was unsafe speed, most likely indicating driving over the speed limit.
  </p>
  <p>The main contributor to Pedestrian fatalities was driver inattention/distraction, meaning that the driver was distracted, and not paying attention to the road. There wasn't necessarily a trend or commonality that contributed to cyclist
    fatalities,
    as the data for cyclist fatalities is smaller compared to motorist and pedestrian fatalities. </p>
  <p>
    Street redesigns,lowering speed limits, adding bike lanes and pedestrian safety designs such as high visibility crosswalks, and bus lanes, would have an immediate and long-lasting impact on reducing collisions and fatalities, says
    Miatkowski. </p>
